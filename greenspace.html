        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The use of urban green space (UGS) is associated with both improved mental and physical health (Lee and
            Maheswaran, 2011), hence its distribution is an important problem of environmental justice in Mexico City.
            During the COVID-19 pandemic the importance of UGS has been elevated as they can provide respite from
            increased time spent indoors (Ugolini et al., 2020). Mexico City has been found to provide significantly
            lower access to UGS for marginalised populations (Fernández-Álvarez, 2017) and the City's COVID-19
            measures have resulted in urban park closures which disproportionately affect low- and middle-income
            neighbourhoods (Mayen Huerta and Cafagna, 2021). This report aims to present an accurate picture of the
            distribution of access to UGS within Mexico City as a first step to reducing inequalities of access.</p>

        <figure>

            <figcaption>Figure 1. Area of Mexico City within a 1 km walk of urban green space (UGS)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>UGS is a limited resource, therefore access depends on the ratio between UGS capacity and the number of
            people potentially utilising it. To model this relationship, network analysis will be performed through an
            enhanced two-step floating catchment area method (Luo and Qi, 2009). This will provide a spatial
            accessibility value at each urban block in Mexico City. These results will then be compared to the
            distribution of poverty in the city which may help inform efforts to improve equity in the city.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>This analysis primarily revolved around the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method
            described by Luo and Qi (2009). The first step of this process is finding the size of the population who
            live within three different travel distance intervals of each UGS (table 1). The population size is then
            multiplied by a weight based on how far it is to walk to the UGS. For each UGS we then find its
            capacity-to-population ratio.</p>
        <p>The second step is to find the weighted sum of the capacity-to-population ratios for UGS nearby each urban
            block to calculate the block's level of access. The resulting value at each urban block incorporates both
            the UGS capacity proximate to each urban block and the amount of demand placed on the UGS.</p>

        <h3>Table 1. Distance Interval Weighting</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Interval (metres)</th>
                    <th>Weighting</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>0 – 500</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>500 – 1500</td>
                    <td>0.5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1500 – 2500</td>
                    <td>0.25</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>To perform this analysis, three primary datasets were used: polygons representing all the UGS in Mexico
            City, point data representing the centroid of each of the city's urban blocks, and a road network layer.</p>

        <figure>

            <figcaption>Figure 2. Overview of workflow to calculate access values</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The E2SFCA process requires a distance matrix as an input, which calculates how far it is to walk from each
            urban block to all the UGS in the city. The process also requires capacity measures for each of the UGS
            polygons. The capacity was based on UGS size categories described by Mayen Huerta (2021), although the
            actual capacity values were estimates (table 2).</p>

        <h3>Table 2. UGS Capacity Estimates</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Size (Hectares)</th>
                    <th>Category</th>
                    <th>Estimated Capacity (People)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>&gt; 100</td>
                    <td>City Park</td>
                    <td>10,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>20 – 100</td>
                    <td>District Park</td>
                    <td>5,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>8 – 20</td>
                    <td>Neighbourhood Park</td>
                    <td>1,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0 – 8</td>
                    <td>Children's Park</td>
                    <td>500</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>With these inputs the E2SFCA analysis was performed by translating the steps outlined above into a series of
            table manipulations (see appendix figure 7). Additionally, three further non-enhanced versions of the
            floating catchment area analysis (Luo and Wang, 2003) were performed to compare the results of the
            techniques. This process differs by only using a single catchment distance and no weightings.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>There were large disparities throughout Mexico City in terms of accessibility to UGS. As can be seen in
            figure 3, the West of the city was the largest region of high accessibility, with the North and
            particularly the South having few or no UGS at all within walking distance. Areas that are faintly blue
            either have few nearby UGS or the proximate population is too large to be serviced by the nearby green
            space. An accessibility value of zero indicates that a given urban block has no parks within 2500 m, but
            higher scores should only be understood as providing relative measures of accessibility rather than
            providing an absolute amount.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/ugs3.png" alt="UGS accessibility in Mexico City">
            <figcaption>Figure 3. UGS accessibility in Mexico City. A higher value is better.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In figure 4, one can see that the distribution of accessibility closely mirrors the distribution of poverty
            in Mexico City. Only small pockets of high UGS accessibility in the East and North appear to ignore this
            trend. To attempt to quantify this relationship, a generalised linear regression was used but it did not
            appear to be linear, with an R-squared value of 0.0085.</p>

                City (from left to right)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Figure 5 reveals that there are relatively few urban blocks in Mexico City within a 500 m walk of a UGS. On
            the other hand, using a 1500 m catchment area we can see that approximately half of Mexico City falls
            within this area, but the same inequalities of access still exist.</p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>The results of this analysis clearly suggest that work must be done to improve access to UGS for lower
            income areas in Mexico City. The solution is unlikely to be as simple as constructing more parks in the
            East and South of the city, however. It is possible that the construction of new UGS will result in
            gentrification (Fernandez et al., 2019) which ultimately may not help the poorer populations of Mexico
            City to gain the benefits of UGS.</p>
        <p>The enhanced two-step floating catchment area approach for this context appears to have been appropriate
            (figure 2), especially when compared to the non-enhanced approach (figure 5). The approach has captured
            the idea that areas closer to UGS tend to have higher accessibility unless too many people rely on a small
            amount of UGS. The enhancement to the method helps to model the fact that when people must travel further
            to reach UGS they are less likely to do so — this is known as the distance-decay effect (Brockmann et al.,
            2006).</p>
        <p>One limitation of the E2SFCA approach relates to its sensitivity to the chosen input capacity values and
            distance-decay weightings. The overall distribution of accessibility, however, will remain the same for
            all sensible inputs, though the inequalities may be more or less extreme. Further problems include not
            considering UGS outside of the confines of the city. An inspection of satellite imagery reveals greenery
            across much of the city's border which could potentially be utilised by those on the city's edges.
            Additionally, it is not evident that UGS access responds linearly to the number of people using the park.
            For example, a UGS may feel safer when many people are using it and therefore become more accessible
            (Mayen Huerta and Cafagna, 2021). Finally, the use of centroids rather than more precise locations to
            represent parks and urban blocks meant that some distance measures were inaccurate, particularly for
            larger parks.</p>
        <p>Through this analysis a clear picture of the distribution of access to UGS has been created. Areas
            identified to have low UGS accessibility should be the focus of efforts to improve environmental justice
            in Mexico City. Further work is required to quantify and validate the intuitive inverse relationship
            between access and poverty levels in Mexico City.</p>
