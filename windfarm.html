        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The wind energy sector in Victoria has grown rapidly in recent decades. It now supplies more than 12% of the
            state's energy requirements (DELWP 2020a) and the Victorian government aims to increase this to 50% by 2050
            (DELWP 2020b). This will substantially reduce Victoria's current reliance on fossil fuels (DELWP 2020a) but
            will require constructing many new wind farms. The aim of this report is to identify which sites in Victoria
            have the best potential to become wind farms.</p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>To site a wind farm requires considering human, environmental and economic factors simultaneously. In
            Australia, 75% of people support wind farms when surveyed (Lothian 2020) and a significant majority believe
            that their benefits outweigh their effects on the visual landscape (ibid). Unfortunately, wind farms pose a
            risk to local bird and bat species who can be injured by the turbine blades (DELWP 2020b). While this risk
            should of course be avoided, the problem is relatively small compared to other factors such as the risk posed
            to birds by domestic cats (Woinarski et al., 2017). Finally, for a wind farm site to be sensible it must
            have sufficient wind velocity as well as be accessible by road and existing electricity infrastructure
            (Baseer et al. 2017).</p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>To consider all relevant criteria and to weight their importance appropriately, a GIS based multi-criteria
            decision analysis (MCDA) was used (Malczewski &amp; Rinner, 2015). The MCDA process began by modelling the
            preferences of a 'development company' with regards to four objectives (table 1). These preferences
            corresponded to ratings out of 100 which were then normalised to generate relative weightings. These
            objectives were reified through the criteria in table 2 and the weighting of each objective was divided
            equally amongst its criteria.</p>

        <p>A set of value ranges was created for each criterion to judge the suitability of each location in Victoria.
            The value ranges for wind speed were chosen based on 6 ms⁻¹ at 50 metres being approximately the minimum
            required for reasonable wind turbine performance (Blakers 2000). Other criteria ranges were modelled on those
            used in similar studies (Baseer et al. 2017; Saraswat et al. 2021) or to create a linear distribution in
            the case of the strategic biodiversity value.</p>

        <p>Suitability scores were then mapped by scoring all of Victoria with regards to each criterion. The scores
            were then combined by taking their weight-adjusted sum. The resulting map was reclassified once more using a
            natural breaks algorithm. The same process was performed for each of the other stakeholder groups:
            environmentalists, anti-wind farm lobbyists and the Victorian State Government (see appendix for ratings).</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 3: Suitability scores for development company stakeholder</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>To identify the three most promising potential wind farm sites, another suitability layer was created using
            ten classes to generate smaller, more discrete regions. The 'regions' tool was then utilised to find the
            three largest contiguous regions which were in the highest suitability class.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Using the development company stakeholder preferences, the largest areas of Victoria classified as 'Very
            Good' were in the South-West. This is predominantly due to the high wind speeds in this region compared to
            the rest of Victoria. Windy coastal and alpine regions were generally not considered due to environmental and
            access constraints. As can be seen in figure 4, the spatial distribution of suitability between the
            Environmentalist and Development Company stakeholders was quite similar. In contrast, the Victorian
            Government and Anti-Wind Farm lobby stakeholder groups had high suitability levels for most locations
            sufficiently far away from populated areas.</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 4: Map of all stakeholder suitability levels</figcaption>

        <p>The three potential sites selected can be seen in figure 5, they are located along major roads connected to
            the City of Ballarat. The selected sites had an average wind speed of 6.33 ms⁻¹ which is greater than the
            6.02 ms⁻¹ average of existing wind turbine locations.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>The three proposed wind farm sites in figure 5 are all located near existing wind turbines. The middle site
            encompasses an area where a planning permit proposal has already been lodged for a wind farm (DELWP 2021e).
            This indicates that the study methodology was valid because wind turbines are unlikely to be constructed in
            these areas if they are truly inappropriate. All three sites appear to be predominantly farmland, hence
            building wind turbines in these locations would require purchasing or leasing the land from its current
            owners. Given the high energy productivity potential and accessibility of these sites compared to their low
            human and environmental impact, they would likely be appropriate additions to the Victorian wind farm
            system.</p>
        <p>The criteria used to score each objective seems to have been appropriate. The areas with the highest
            suitability scores are far away from cities and wildlife areas. The addition of the strategic biodiversity
            values meant that important areas for Victorian ecosystems which are not formally protected were still
            considered in the analysis. However, the accessibility criteria may require internal reweighting as the
            slope of the terrain is arguably less important than proximity to power lines and roads.</p>
        <p>The limitations of the study are most evident in the small number of datasets used and their limited
            resolution. For example, the use of only mean wind speed may hide considerable variability in wind speeds
            throughout the year. While seabird habitat data was used to exclude some coastal areas from the analysis,
            information about inland bird distribution and migratory paths should also have been included (Taoufik and
            Fekri, 2021). The use of a km² cell size meant that potentially suitable shorelines were poorly resolved and
            that small distance restrictions were at times not accurately represented.</p>
        <p>Another issue in this analysis was the subjective nature of the criteria score intervals and the
            interpretation of suitability scores. Most similar studies used a more objective 'fuzzy set' approach to
            define their criteria scores (Aydin et al., 2010; Sánchez-Lozano et al., 2016). Another analysis approach
            such as cost-revenue optimisation (Van Haaren &amp; Fthenakis, 2011) may have provided a more objective
            threshold for when a site is considered viable.</p>
        <p>The practical outcome of this study is to drastically reduce the search area for any party wishing to
            construct a new wind farm. It demonstrates that there is an abundance of suitable area for wind farms to be
            constructed in Victoria to expand its wind power capacity.</p>
